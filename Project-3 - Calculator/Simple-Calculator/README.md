# Simple Calculator Website

## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a **Simple Calculator**. This project is a perfect way to explore the basics of JavaScript, especially in handling mathematical operations, updating the DOM dynamically, and creating an interactive user interface. Whether you're new to web development or looking to sharpen your JavaScript skills, this Simple Calculator project is a great starting point.

## Project Overview

The **Simple Calculator** is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project highlights how to create a responsive and user-friendly interface while efficiently handling user inputs to perform calculations.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean and straightforward design for easy interaction.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear and Delete Functionality**: Users can clear the input or delete the last entry with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures consistent usability across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web page and input elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator interface, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the calculation logic and user interactions.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
